Hello, I'M JTRedEye26

I am 21 years old with a diploma in computer programming that mostly focused on back end web development(sql, server hosting, and back end data manipulation).
My most recent project is an internal web based ticketing system for my IT department hosted with xampp.
Other projects of mine can be found in my repositories but they are are all JFrame projects from when I was in school.
When I'm not working I like to spend my time gaming or tinkering with e-waste.
I would like to broden my programming knowlage into more fun things like game development using unity.
Hit me up on discord if you want to chat JTRedEye26#1715
